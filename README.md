#AR Project Overview

As a web-based augmented reality project, the application had to be optimized to work on different browsers and operating systems. We also put a lot of effort into ensuring that the interactive elements and 3D animations perform well on almost any hardware.

With the power of AR technology, we can now bring virtual content to the real world. In this project, we have created an interactive AR scene that you can explore using your smartphone or tablet.
To get started, simply open the link to our project on your device, and point your camera at the marker provided. As you do, you will see a virtual asset appear on top of the marker, which you can interact with by clicking on it.

But that's not all! We have also added an exciting feature to the experience. When you show the marker, a soothing music will play, which will enhance your experience and make it more immersive.

We hope you enjoy our AR project, and have fun exploring the virtual world we have created for you!
